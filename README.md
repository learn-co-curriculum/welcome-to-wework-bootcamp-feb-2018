# Welcome To WeWork Bootcamp Feb 2018

Hi! Welcome to the innaugural class of the WeWork Employee Bootcamp with me, Avi Flombaum, co-founder, Chief Product Officer, and Dean of Flatiron School.

I'm so excited to be teaching and learning with you all, it's actually been a bit since I've run a class at Flatiron School. I wanted to take sometime to tell you a few things:

1. What We're Going to Learn
2. How this Course is Going to Work
3. Expectations About Our Community

Let's jump right in.

## What We're Going to Learn

We can't cover everything in programming in the time we have together, and I know you might have heard we were going to teach Javascript, but I changed my mind and we're going to learn Ruby. I love Ruby, it's designed to make you happy, it's values are aligned with ours, and WeWork uses Ruby.

What we're going to build is [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) in a few different ways so we can explore concepts in programming in a simple, universal, "domain" (or probem).

We'll build Tic Tac Toe in components first and then put it all together. Our interface will be [the Command Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and then hopefully the Web via a Ruby framework called Sinatra.

It's going to be awesome, I promise.

### Procedural Ruby

We're going to learn the basics of programming and Ruby by building all the components of Tic Tac Toe individually. At the end, we'll put it together and we'll have a working 2 player Command Line Version of Tic Tac Toe.

### Object Oriented Ruby

Object Orientation is my favorite concept and design pattern in programming. There's a chance, depending on fast we move, we might skip this unit and go straight to the web, but hopefully we'll get a chance to ["refactor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) our first version of Tic Tac Toe into objects.

### The Web and Sinatra

Again, depending on how fast we go, I'd love to then take our Tic Tac Toe and put it on the Web with a framework called Sinatra. We'll cover a bit of HTML, learn about HTTP and how the Web Works, and build a 2 player version that we can deploy to Heroku.

## How this Course is Going to Work

The first lecture will also cover a lot of the material covered in this section. Orientation is going to cover a lot of the basics of learning how to code, how to use Learn.co and the tools required to be a real developer like GitHub, a text editor, a terminal, test-driven-development, and etc. The goal of orientation is to make sure that you're all ready to get started with your Week 1 material. I will be around this weekend on [the Learn Slack](https://learn-co.slack.com/messages/G8ZUY7CP4) should you need help. You can also email me [af@wework.com](mailto:af@wework.com). **You can always Ask a Question on Learn too!**

During the week, you're expected to move through the curriculum in the week's topic on Learn.co on your own. It's going to be work - set aside time to do it. Clear you calendar. Tell your friends and family in advance that you're busy. Wake up early. Don't watch TV. Stop checking Reddit and Twitter. Focus. It'll change your life if you do.

Every week we'll do lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:30pm for 2 hours. This will be a chance to introduce and review concepts, meet each other, pair up on labs, and make progress.

If you don't do the week's curriculum, the lectures are going to be a bit hard to follow, so again, I highly recommend you make a calendar and explicitly schedule your learning time in advance, it helps a lot.

That's basically the plan. You'll always have access to this curriculum so even if you can't finish everything in the time we have together, you'll still be able to do it on your own and with the Flatiron School community.
