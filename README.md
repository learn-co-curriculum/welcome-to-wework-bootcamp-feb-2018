# Welcome To WeWork Bootcamp Feb 2018

Hi! Welcome to the innaugural class of the WeWork Employee Bootcamp with me, Avi Flombaum, co-founder, Chief Product Officer, and Dean of Flatiron School.

I'm so excited to be teaching and learning with you all, it's actually been a bit since I've run a class at Flatiron School. I wanted to take sometime to tell you a few things:

1. What We're Going to Learn
2. How this Course is Going to Work
3. Expectations About Our Community

Let's jump right in.

## What We're Going to Learn

We can't cover everything in programming in the time we have together, and I know you might have heard we were going to teach Javascript, but I changed my mind and we're going to learn Ruby. I love Ruby, it's designed to make you happy, it's values are aligned with ours, and WeWork uses Ruby.

What we're going to build is [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) in a few different ways so we can explore concepts in programming in a simple, universal, "domain" (or probem).

We'll build Tic Tac Toe in components first and then put it all together. Our interface will be [the Command Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and then hopefully the Web via a Ruby framework called Sinatra.

It's going to be awesome, I promise.

### Procedural Ruby

We're going to learn the basics of programming and Ruby by building all the components of Tic Tac Toe individually. At the end, we'll put it together and we'll have a working 2 player Command Line Version of Tic Tac Toe.

### Object Oriented Ruby

Object Orientation is my favorite concept and design pattern in programming. There's a chance, depending on fast we move, we might skip this unit and go straight to the web, but hopefully we'll get a chance to ["refactor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) our first version of Tic Tac Toe into objects.

### The Web and Sinatra

Again, depending on how fast we go, I'd love to then take our Tic Tac Toe and put it on the Web with a framework called Sinatra. We'll cover a bit of HTML, learn about HTTP and how the Web Works, and build a 2 player version that we can deploy to Heroku.

## How this Course is Going to Work

### Schedule

Lectures will happen using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download), so go ahead and download that client if you haven't already.

The first lecture will also cover a lot of the material covered in this section. Orientation is going to cover a lot of the basics of learning how to code, how to use Learn.co and the tools required to be a real developer like GitHub, a text editor, a terminal, test-driven-development, and etc. The goal of orientation is to make sure that you're all ready to get started with your Week 1 material. I will be around this weekend on [the Learn Slack](https://learn-co.slack.com/messages/G8ZUY7CP4) should you need help. You can also email me [af@wework.com](mailto:af@wework.com). **You can always Ask a Question on Learn too!**

During the week, you're expected to move through the curriculum in the week's topic on Learn.co on your own. It's going to be work - set aside time to do it. Clear you calendar. Tell your friends and family in advance that you're busy. Wake up early. Don't watch TV. Stop checking Reddit and Twitter. Focus. It'll change your life if you do.

Every week we'll do lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:30pm for 2 hours. This will be a chance to introduce and review concepts, meet each other, pair up on labs, and make progress.

If you don't do the week's curriculum, the lectures are going to be a bit hard to follow, so again, I highly recommend you make a calendar and explicitly schedule your learning time in advance, it helps a lot.

I tried to make it so that the Thursday lectures cover a lot because then you'll have all weekend to work on the labs and review topics.

That's basically the plan. You'll always have access to this curriculum so even if you can't finish everything in the time we have together, you'll still be able to do it on your own and with the Flatiron School community.

### Learn.co and Learning with Flatiron School

Learn.co is the educational platform we built at Flatiron School to power all of our classes. It's a bit different than other online learning systems, as you might be able to tell already. Here's the big stuff you need to know right now.

1. We write. A lot. Programming is reading and writing all day and if you're serious about this career you might as well get used to reading about code a ton. We also think that videos are just too easy to not pay attention too when you're watching. Code is all details and syntax and videos make it hard to grasp those. I'll be adding some video lectures to the course but expect to see a lot of READMEs. Read. Read all of it. Seriously, it's how you learn. The "Curriculum" link on the top left will reveal the track and the topics, units, and lessons.

2. We use real tools. There are no REPLs here or contrived programming environments that over-simplify things. You're going to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) we built called the [Learn IDE](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide). It comes with a terminal that provides you with a programming environment so you don't have to worry about setting up a proper environment.

3. Community is everything to us. Learn is social. You'll see people asking questions, we encourage you to ask questions (it's how you learn), we expect you to help others when you can (and you should always try, 2 brains trying to figure something out is always better than 1). You can self organize study groups to meet other students and work together. And we want you to be a part of our **[Slack community](http://slack.learn.co) to hang out and [discuss the course](https://learn-co.slack.com/messages/G8ZUY7CP4)** and life and everything.

We're going to do our best to staff the "Ask a Question" feature on Learn with teachers so that you get answers faster but we can't promise anything. I'll also be around a bunch during the week so don't be shocked if I pop-in to answer your question and help. I really do love meeting students and teaching.

Finally, all of our lectures are going to be hosted via [Zoom](https://zoom.us) so I recommend downloading the client in advance.

**All Lectures will be recorded and added to the curriculum so you can always re-watch them.**

## Expectations About Our Community

Finally, really quick, I want to say that our community is very important to us. Flatiron School is a supportive, open, and friendly place. We have a 0 tolerance for any sort of meanness, racism, sexism, harrassment, abuse, and such. You can read our full [Code of Conduct](http://flatironschool.com/code-of-conduct/) and we take it really seriously. Let's avoid discussing topics that are controversial and focus instead on code and how much we love learning. So please keep this place amazing. Should anything come up, please reach out to [support@flatironschool.com](mailto:support@flatironschool.com) or DM me on Slack or email me directly [avi@flatironschool.com](mailto:avi@flatironschool.com). _Not super worried about this because #wearewework but it never hurts to remind people._
